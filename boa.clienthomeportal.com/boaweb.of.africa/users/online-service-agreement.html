You will have access to those Services that are approved by the Bank for you and the applicable Activated Account or Activated Accounts. 
</p>

<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Sans-serif; font-size: 11px;">5.<strong> Electronic Agreement.</strong> You are agreeing to enter into this OLB Agreement electronically. By your electronic agreement, you consent to all terms and conditions governing use of the Service as set forth in this OLB Agreement. We will make a printed copy of this OLB Agreement available at your request. However, we recommend that you print a copy this OLB Agreement for your records. </p>

<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Sans-serif; font-size: 11px;">6.	<strong>Consent to Receive Electronic Notices.</strong> By using the Service and/or agreeing to the E-Sign Consent, you consent to and agree that:
<ul style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Sans-serif; font-size: 11px;">
  <li>Any notice, record or other type of information that is provided to you in connection with your accounts, Activated Accounts or the Service, such as account disclosures, change-in-terms notices, privacy disclosures for consumers (only), fee schedules, transaction notices and alerts, account status notices, service messages, and any other type of notice, (each a “Customer Notice”), may be sent to you electronically. A Customer Notice may be provided as a separate electronic document or may be included in an electronic account statement. An electronic Customer Notice sent to any account owner shall be deemed sent to, and received by, all account owners on the day we send it. We reserve the right to send a Customer Notice in paper format by postal mail.</li>
  <li>You will promptly report to us any change to your contact information, including email address, name, physical address, mailing address (if different), and telephone numbers. You may update this information by contacting us at 1-800-238-4486. Changes to certain contact information can be completed in the Service.</li>
  
  <li>We will not be obligated to provide any Customer Notice to you in paper form unless you specifically request us to do so. You may request a paper copy of a Customer Notice by contacting us at 1-800-238-4486. Unless set forth in the Account Agreement you will not be charged a fee.</li>
  
  <li>You may withdraw this consent to receive electronic delivery of Customer Notices by contacting us at the address or telephone number in Section 36 of this OLB Agreement. However, withdrawing your consent means you may no longer be able to access the Service, and fee discounts or waivers associated with use of the Service may be discontinued.</li>
  
  <li>In order to receive Customer Notices online you must maintain computer hardware and software of sufficient capability to be able to access and retain them electronically. See Section 8 below.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<br>

<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Sans-serif; font-size: 11px;">7.	<strong>E-Mail Address.</strong> A current, valid email address is critical to our successful delivery of the Service to you. You agree to maintain an active email account at all times and record such email address within your profile in the Service. You further agree to promptly notify us of a change of email address by changing the address at the Profile link within the Service.<br>
<br>

If, for any reason the email address you provide us changes or becomes inoperable for more than a short period of time, you agree to contact us immediately so that we can arrange to provide you with Customer Notices and account statements through other means.
<br>
<br>
If we contact you at the email address of record within the Service and learn that the email is undeliverable to that address, we may, at our discretion:
<ul style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Sans-serif; font-size: 11px;">
<li>require you to provide a valid email address at next login attempt;</li>
<li>require you to accept this OLB Agreement again at next login attempt;</li>
<li>attempt to contact you through another means to obtain a valid email address;</li> 
<li>disable the Service for other users (Online Banking for Small Business only); and/or</li>
<li>discontinue electronic Customer Notices and instead provide them by paper.</li>
</ul><br>

<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Sans-serif; font-size: 11px;">If you have chosen to receive account statements in electronic form, such as pdf format, and you do not provide us with a new email address, you agree that we may continue to comply with the terms of this OLB Agreement and the statement delivery preference you have indicated within the Service until such time as you instruct us otherwise.
</p> 

<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Sans-serif; font-size: 11px;">8.<strong> Computer Requirements.</strong> The Service requires you to have certain computer capabilities, which we may change from time to time without prior notice to you. Refer to <a href="olb/welcome/computer-requirements6012.html">www.unionbank.com/computerrequirements</a> for our current computer requirements.</p>

<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Sans-serif; font-size: 11px;">9.	<strong>Activated Accounts.</strong> You agree and acknowledge that your Activated Accounts may not have access to all the Services described in this Agreement and/or may have restrictions that only provide for limited use of a particular Service. For example, your Investment Services IRA and brokerage accounts (excluding the cash balance portion of your Portfolio Connection® account) do not have access to all the Services and are limited to the viewing balance information feature offered by the Service. Generally, the Services described herein, state which types of Activated Accounts are eligible for the applicable Service. Also, we may allow other types of accounts to be connected to the Service from time to time. Linked accounts are referred to as "Activated Accounts."  Further, we reserve the right to determine which accounts can be connected to the Service. 
</p>


<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Sans-serif; font-size: 11px;">10.  	<strong>User Authentication.</strong> We reserve the right to deny access to the Service or reject a transaction on an Activated Account through the Service without notice to you if we believe that there is risk of unauthorized, illegal, or fraudulent activity. You agree that we may, in our sole discretion, require verification of user identity, in a manner satisfactory to us, at any time before allowing access or login to the Service or before authorizing an online transaction from an Activated Account. Such verification may be in any form we determine appropriate and may include, without limitation:  (a) verification of User ID and/or password; (b) verification of personal information contained in Bank records;  (c) correct response to previously submitted personal questions, sometimes referred to as “security” or “challenge” questions; (d) correct response to questions devised from public records and consumer reporting agencies on subjects only the user likely would have personal knowledge, sometimes called “out of wallet” or “knowledge based authentication” questions; (e) verification of online activity by simultaneous contact through a non-online channel, sometimes called “verify by phone” or “out of band” authentication; or (f) any verification procedure that we may determine appropriate. <br>
<br>
In the event you do not successfully provide the information requested, we may, at our sole discretion: (a) refuse a transaction; (b) require you to contact us by phone or in person at a branch for further validation of identity; (c) cancel the Service; and/or (d) take any security precautions we deem appropriate to prevent unauthorized use of the Service or Activated Account or account.
</p>






<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Sans-serif; font-size: 11px;">11. 	<strong>Security Procedures.</strong> The Codes are the Security Procedures.  You agree that the Bank may use the Security Procedures to verify the authenticity of an instruction, transfer request or payment order request (collectively, a “Communication”) delivered to the Bank in your name.  If the Bank verifies the authenticity of the Communication using the Security Procedures, then the Bank may rely on it and you will be obligated on the Communication, whether or not the Communication was authorized by you (unless the Communication is an electronic fund transfer under Regulation E, then you may have additional rights). Also, if a Communication was authorized by you, then you will be obligated on the Communication even if the Bank did not verify its authenticity using the Security Procedures and even if the Security Procedures would have prevented error.  You agree that the Security Procedures are intended to verify authenticity and not to detect error. 
You agree to consider the size, type and frequency of transfers, Communications, or other money transactions you use the Services to accomplish.  You will consider the risks presented by the possibility of unauthorized access to these Services and your obligation on the Communications even though they are unauthorized.  You agree and acknowledge that the Security Procedures are commercially reasonable for you, after considering these risks. Further, you agree and acknowledge and that you will be bound by the Communications in your name as set forth above. <br>
<br>
Further, in your review of the Services, you agree to notify the Bank in the event your use of the Services would necessitate or be better served by a level of security that exceeds that offered by the Security Procedures you are using for that Service.  If you fail to notify the Bank, then you acknowledge and agree that the security aspects of the Services are appropriate for your needs and will provide you with a commercially reasonable degree of security against unauthorized use.
</p>


<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Sans-serif; font-size: 11px;">12.	 <strong>User Responsibility for Online Security.</strong> To sign on to the Service, you are required to input a User ID and password.  After initial online setup, you will be required to select your own password.  To help safeguard your security, you should change your password frequently.  Your password can be changed within the Service.  Do not write your password anywhere or store it on your computer.  If you forget your password, use the Forgot Password process in the Service or call us at 1-800-238-4486 to regain access. You should never include your password in any oral, written, faxed, or email communication with us or anyone.  No Bank employee will ever ask you for your password.<br>
<br>
You acknowledge that maintaining confidentiality of the Activated Account is your responsibility. You agree to maintain your account information and online User ID and password in strict confidence in order to prevent unauthorized access to your accounts and the Service.  You further agree to immediately notify us of any unauthorized use, or potential unauthorized use, of the Service or Activated Account, or of any suspicious or unexplained activity in the Activated Account.  You acknowledge that anyone with whom you share or who otherwise uses your User ID and password will have access to your Activated Accounts for all purposes, including making withdrawals and transfers regardless of ownership of such accounts.  Also, you agree and acknowledge that due to the single sign-on feature your User ID and password will have access to your brokerage accounts, which are governed by UBIS Portfolio Connection Agreements, including but limited to, the online banking terms and conditions of the UBIS Investment Service Agreement, and that anyone with whom you share or who otherwise uses your User ID and password can place trades and engage in other brokerage activity.   You further acknowledge that you will be responsible for any access to and from an Activated Account for any purpose.</p>


<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Sans-serif; font-size: 11px;">13.	<strong>Account Statements.</strong> You may obtain periodic statements for your Activated Accounts, which are your checking, savings and/or money market accounts held at the Bank, either online within the Service or in paper format delivered by postal mail.  You agree to receive statements online for all accounts eligible for online statements in the Service.  You may change or indicate your preference by selecting the applicable choice within the Service or by contacting us at 1-800-238-4486.  Online statements contain the same information as a paper statement, in addition to access to images of the front and back of paid checks and deposit slips.  If you choose to receive statements online, we will notify you electronically when a statement is available for viewing within the Service.  Each such electronic “statement ready” notice shall be deemed sent to, and received by, all account owners on the day we send it. You agree to contact us promptly if you do not receive your online statement for any reason. <br>
<br>
Online account statements, including images of the front and back of paid checks and deposit slips, will be available for 7 years after date of delivery.  You may print the documents or save them to your computer.  If you encounter difficulty saving or printing the online statement or images of supporting transactions, contact us at 1-800-238-4486 for a paper copy of the documents.  You can terminate online statement delivery for any of your Activated Accounts at any time by changing your statement delivery preference to receive a “paper statement only” within the Service or by calling us at 1-800-238-4486.  A fee to receive a paper statement may apply. See the applicable Account Agreement.
We will make statements for your Activated Accounts available to you as required by law or upon request.  We may stop making statements available at any time without notice in such circumstances as when your account becomes inactive, in default, in overdraft, or in similar circumstances.
</p>



<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Sans-serif; font-size: 11px;">14.	<strong>Viewing Information.</strong> You can use the Service to obtain balance and transaction information about your Activated Accounts. Ledger Balance and Available Balance shown are defined in the applicable Account Agreement. In addition, information about deposits which have not yet posted is available. <br>
<br>
Balance and transaction information provided to you as part of the Service is not the official record of your account, Activated Account or its activity.  Your account statement, furnished to you by us in electronic or paper format, is the official record.  Balance and transaction information is generally updated regularly, but is subject to adjustment and correction and therefore should not be relied upon by you for taking, or not taking, any action.
<br>
<br>
If you overdraw your checking account and you have deposit account overdraft protection, the credit to your checking account will appear on the day the checking account is overdrawn, and the debit to your savings account will not appear until the following day. This means that your savings account balance will be overstated by the transfer amount for one day.  If a transfer exceeds the available credit on your Cash Reserve or overdraft protection line or business line of credit, the funds will appear in the account to which you transferred them, but will not be available for withdrawal.  The transfer may be reversed the following Business Day.
</p>




<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Sans-serif; font-size: 11px;">15.	<strong>Transfers Between Your Accounts Held with the Bank.</strong> Through the Service, you may transfer the amount of available funds from an Activated Account owned by you to another Activated Account.  Transfers to and from your Union Bank Activated Accounts are usually effective immediately if the “from” account has adequate funds and security controls are met. You agree that you will not attempt to add accounts to your Service that you do not have the authority on which to transfer funds.<br>
<br>

At our discretion, we may establish customer eligibility requirements for transfers.  We may further establish limits on amount and frequency of transfers.  We may change such eligibility requirements and transfer limits without prior notice to you.  If a transfer exceeds current limits, it will not be processed.  Funds availability and cutoff times are set forth in Section 31 of this Agreement.  If there are insufficient available funds in an account you designate to make a transfer, or if making a transfer would cause your line of credit account to exceed your credit limit, we may refuse or reverse the transfer.  If we choose, we may complete the transfer by overdrawing your account or by making an advance on your line of credit in excess of your credit limit.  We may charge a fee for each transfer request that would overdraw your account (or exceed your credit limit), whether or not we complete the transfer.  Each transfer made from a line of credit account will be treated as a loan advance.

<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Sans-serif; font-size: 11px;">16.  	<strong>Transfers Between Your Accounts Held with the Bank and with other Financial Institutions. </strong><br>
<br>
The Service allows you to engage in external transfers where you can make transfers from one or more of your deposit accounts held with the Bank, which includes your checking, savings, money market, and your Portfolio Connection® account (specifically from the cash balance portion of your Portfolio Connection® account) to deposit accounts owned by you at another financial institution located in the United States. Also, you can engage in transfers where you can instruct us to transfer money from your account at other financial institutions to one or more of your deposit accounts held at the Bank. These external transfers to and from your deposit accounts are referred to as an “Owned External Transfer” or collectively as “Owned External Transfers.”
<br>
<br>
<strong>Frequency and Dollar Limitations.</strong> Each Owned External Transfer request through the Service has a minimum requirement of $10.00. Also, the dollar limitations set forth below for each type of Owned External Transfer apply independently to outgoing and incoming transfers of the same type. <br>
<br>
However, when it comes to the dollar limits for “all outstanding Owned External Transfers,” all outgoing and incoming Owned External Transfers that are “in process” will be aggregated and included in the calculation for the “limit on all in process Owned External Transfers.” Moreover, the dollar limits for “all in process Owned External Transfers” discussed below are the maximum dollar amounts that can be “in process” at any given time for that particular type of transfer (again, this includes both outgoing and incoming Owned External Transfer requests for the particular transfer in question, e.g. Standard Owned External Transfer and High Limit Owned External Transfer). When you reach your "process limit" you will not be able to schedule additional Owned External Transfers (incoming or outgoing) via the Service until the status indicator on the “History” tab shows a "Completed, Paid or E-Sent" status. 
<br>
<br>
It may be possible that the two types of  Owned External Transfers, as listed and defined below, with their corresponding dollar limits, may not be available to you at all times. Generally, the Service allows you to use the “Standard Owned External Transfer” initially and then you may become eligible for “High Limit Owned External Transfer.”  In order to be eligible for the High Limit Owned External Transfer, you must: (i) have no previous Owned External Transfers fail; (ii) have previously successfully completed an outgoing Owned External Transfer between $1,000 and $5,000; and (iii) have had 60 days elapse since the successful Owned External Transfer set forth in the foregoing (ii).  
<br>
<br>
In the event that you become eligible for a “High Limit Owned External Transfer” then those dollar limits will replace the dollar limits set forth for “Standard Owned External Transfer.”  You will see your eligible limits on the “Make Transfer” tab within the Service when you select “Owned External” account as the “Transfer From” or “Transfer To” account.
<br>
<br>
Finally, based on your use of the Service and status of your deposit accounts associated with the Service we may terminate your ability to use “High Limit Owned External Transfer” from time to time.

<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Sans-serif; font-size: 11px;">
  The fees for engaging in an Owned External Transfer are set forth in applicable screens of the Service and/or in your applicable fee schedule. 
  <br>
  <br>
  
  <strong>Cut Off Hours; Business Days.</strong> You cannot schedule same day or next day Owned External Transfers through the Service.  You must allow a minimum of three Business Days for the Owned External Transfer to be completed. Also, when you schedule Owned External Transfers through the Service, the Service will deem any Owned External Transfer instruction received after 10:00 p.m. Pacific Time on a Business Day as though it was received by the Service on the next Business Day. Further, any recurring Owned External Transfer request that falls on a Saturday, Sunday or a Bank holiday will be deemed as though it was received on the next Business Day. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Setting Up One-Time and Recurring Owned External Transfers.</strong> The Service allows you to set up one-time or recurring Owned External Transfers. The frequency options for the recurring intervals are set forth in the “Recurring Transfers Settings” window offered by the Service. However, there are limitations on how far in the future you can schedule either a one-time or recurring Owned External Transfer. Specifically, any Owned External Transfer instruction for a future one-time Owned External Transfer may be scheduled 364 days in advance. Also, any Owned External Transfer instruction for a recurring Owned External Transfers may be scheduled for a maximum of 999 recurring payments.  Note, Business Account customers are not permitted to use a Personal Account to fund an Owned External Transfer in Online Banking for Small Business. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Cancelling Owned External Transfers.</strong> You can cancel any Owned External Transfer that has not been processed by selecting the “x” delete icon in the Actions column on the “Scheduled Transfers” tab. However, if the Owned External Transfer is scheduled on the same Business Day that you want to cancel it, then the Service will not let you cancel your Owner External Transfer. Also, for future scheduled Owned External Transfers, you must transmit your request to skip or cancel an Owner External Transfer before 10:00 p.m. on the Business Day before your Owned External Transfer is processed. </p>
<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Sans-serif; font-size: 11px;">17.<strong> Online Bill Payment.</strong> Our Online Bill Payment Service (the “Bill Pay Service”), which is part of the Services, allows you to initiate bill payments (collectively the “Bill Payments” and individually a “Bill Payment”) through the Bill Pay Service to one or more payees (collectively the “Payees” and individually a “Payee”).  Specifically, you can use the Bill Pay Service to:</p>
<ul style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Sans-serif; font-size: 11px;">
<li>Pay bills to merchants, institutions, or individuals with a U.S. address only. Also, some bills may be paid on the same Business Day you log onto the Bill Pay Service. There is a $15 fee for having a bill paid through the Bill Pay Service on the same Business Day.  This fee is subject to change. Please refer to your Fee Schedule for current applicable fees.</li> 
<li>Make a payment on a personal or small business line of credit that you have with the Bank. This includes, but is not limited to, your Union Bank credit card and loan accounts.</li> 
<li>Receive an eBill, which is an electronic bill (for monies you owe) sent from a third party to the Bill Pay Service, by participating Payees (not all Payees offer eBills). </li>
<li>Set up Bill Payment instructions for both non-eBills and eBills to allow for Bill Payments to be made on a one-time or recurring basis.</li>
</ul><br>
 
<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Sans-serif; font-size: 11px;"><strong>Availability and Use.</strong> The Bill Pay Service is generally available seven days a week and 24 hours a day.  However, the Bill Pay Service may from time to time be unavailable due to maintenance (please see the heading “Service Unavailability” below for further information). The Bill Pay Service allows you to fund payments from your checking and money market accounts held with the Bank in order to pay third parties or to make payments for loans held with the Bank. Also, the Bill Pay Service allows you to make transfers from your Portfolio Connection® account (specifically from the cash balance portion of your Portfolio Connection® account) in order to pay third parties or to make payments for loans held with the Bank. The Bill Pay Service is only available for the types of accounts listed in this paragraph and is not available for other Activated Accounts or accounts. Refer to the applicable Account Agreement for further details.    Further, the Bill Pay Service and this Agreement do not alter your liability or obligations that currently exist between you and your Payees (including, but not limited to, Union Bank.<br>
<br>

<strong>Making Payments on Personal or Small Business Loans.</strong> You may use the Bill Pay Service as a means to provide instructions to the Bank to fund payments from your checking or money market account or Portfolio Connection® account in order to make one or more payments on a one-time or recurring basis for loans. Specifically, you may make Bill Payments on loans held with the Bank, including, but not limited to, your mortgage, home equity line of credit or loan, auto loan, cash reserve line of credit, personal loan, and commercial loan.  You agree and acknowledge that you are responsible for paying the amount due on your loan for the applicable payment period and that the Bank is not responsible if the Bill Pay Service accepts and processes a payment that is not sufficient to meet the minimum or other amount due for the period in question. Further, in the event you want to pay off any remaining balance owed on your loan, you agree and acknowledge that it is your responsibility to determine the amount and the date for which the outstanding balance must be paid in full in order to avoid further finance charges, interest or other fees. The Bank recommends that you contact Consumer Loans at 1-800-237-0561 or Mortgage Loans at 1-800-888-5990 to determine the outstanding balance and date that the outstanding balance payment must be received in order to pay the loan in full.  
<br>
<br>
All Bill Payments scheduled through the Bill Pay Service to make a payment to the Bank for loans at the Bank will only be processed by the Bank if you have sufficient available funds in the applicable Pay From account (as defined below).  The Bank may consider any overdraft protection products or lines of credit linked to your Pay From account when deciding whether to execute your Bill Payment request.  
<br>
<br>
<strong>Pay From Account. </strong> Each Bill Payment request that you initiate through the Bill Pay Service must have a designated Activated Account, that is a checking, money market, or Portfolio Connection account, which will be used to fund the Bill Payment.  Specifically, the first time you initiate a request for a Bill Payment through the Bill Pay Service to make a payment to the Bank or a third party, you must indicate the Activated Account from which you want the money to be debited in order to fund the Bill Payment (the "Pay From” account). Thereafter, that designated Activated Account will be the default Pay From account for that specific Payee, provided that the Activated Account remains in an active and Bill Payment-eligible status.  You may set up a different Activated Account for each Bill Payment; however, recurring Bill Payments must use the same Activated Account you designated for the first Bill Payment in the recurring series for the particular Payee, for all recurring payments. 
<br>
<br>
<strong>Designation of a Payee.</strong>  You can use the Bill Pay Service to pay an individual or a business. However, you can only designate Payees with U.S. addresses. We may refuse to accept certain parties as Payees or may delete Payees from our system and/or Bill Pay Service if you do not transfer funds to them for an extended period of time.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Payment Processor. </strong>You agree and authorize the Bank’s use of a third party payment processor (“Payment Processor”) in order to facilitate one or more Bill Payments. Specifically, you agree and acknowledge that the Bank and/or the Payment Processor may send Bill Payments on your behalf in order to execute one or more Bill Payment requests delivered in your name to the Payee through the Bill Pay Service by: (i) sending funds belonging to the Payment Processor to your Payee and then debiting your Pay From account on the Arrive By date (as defined below); or (ii) creating a negotiable instrument drawn off your Pay From account that uses your Pay From account routing and account number (“Bill Pay Draft”) and making it payable to the Payee you designated in the Bill Pay Service. 
<br>
<br>
<strong>Payment Methods.</strong> The Bill Pay Service, which includes the Bank’s use of a Payment Processor, may complete your Bill Payment by transferring funds electronically (“Electronic Payment Method”) from the Payment Processor’s deposit account to your Payee, or by mailing or otherwise delivering a paper check (“Check Payment Method”) payable to the Payee, drawn on the Payment Processor’s corporate account, to render the payment on your behalf. In some cases, the Payment Processor will create a Bill Pay Draft (“Draft Payment Method”) payable to the Payee, drawn off of your Pay From account, and mail it by regular mail through the U.S. Postal Service.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Mail Merge.</strong> You agree and acknowledge that the Bill Pay Service and/or Payment Processor may comingle in one envelope, paper check or Bill Pay Draft payments payable to different payees that share the exact same address. This means the Payment Processor may send your Bill Payment and other bill payments, belonging to users of this Bill Pay Service and/or users of other bill pay services offered by unrelated institutions, by U.S. mail in the same envelope. However, please note that in order for there to be a mail merge by the Bill Pay Service and/or Payment Processor, you and others would have to schedule Bill Payments or bill payments with the same Arrive By date to two or more payees with the same exact address. You agree and acknowledge that the Bank is not responsible in any manner whatsoever for the ability of third parties to view your Bill Payment in the event of mail merge.  
<br>
<br>
<strong>Scheduling Your Payments.</strong>  You choose the date the Payee will receive your Bill Payment (the “Arrive By” date).  Typically, electronic payments, under the Electronic Payment Method, as defined above, can be delivered in 1 – 2 Business Days, and paper check payments, under the Check Payment Method, as defined above and Bill Pay Draft payments, under the Draft Payment Method, as defined above, can be delivered in 2 – 4 Business Days. The Bill Pay Service will not permit you to select an Arrive By date earlier than the earliest possible Arrive By date available for each Payee. Specifically, the Bill Pay Service will display the earliest date you can designate as the Arrive By date for each Payee. You can choose the earliest date displayed or you can choose a later date. 
<br>
<br>
You agree and acknowledge that it is your responsibility to schedule payments through the Bill Pay Service in a manner that allows for a sufficient amount of time for the Bill Payment to be processed and delivered before the day by which the Payee indicates your payment is due (the “Due Date”).  Further, the Bank recommends that you do not schedule a Bill Payment with an Arrive By date that falls within any grace period (meaning the period between the Due Date and the date for which the Payee deems that your payment is not considered late) that your Payee grants you.  The Bank will not be liable for late charges, penalties, interest, finance charges and other damages if you schedule your Bill Payment with an Arrive By date that falls within a grace period.
<br>
<br>
Further, the Bank assumes no responsibility for late Bill Payments if you do not properly schedule and submit your request.  To ensure that critical or time-sensitive payments, such as insurance premiums, are made in a timely manner, we recommend that you schedule those Bill Payments for such payments well in advance of their Due Dates. Payees may require extra time to post a Bill Payment to your account held with the Payee because they do not receive a payment coupon or invoice number with the Bill Payment. Some Payees disclose the extra processing time they require to post payments that do not include a payment coupon or invoice.
<br>
<br>
Finally, the Bank strongly recommends against using the Bill Pay Service to pay your taxes, as local, state and federal agencies frequently require that coupons accompany these payments. For this reason, the Bank will not be liable for penalties, interest or other damages of any kind to tax agencies.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Debiting Your Pay From Account. </strong> The date on which your applicable Pay From account is debited as a result of the Bill Pay Service executing your Bill Payment request depends on what method was used by the Bill Pay Service for the particular Payee. 
<br>
<br>
Specifically, if the Bill Pay Service pays your Payee using the Electronic Payment Method, the payment method will display as “Electronic” on the History tab,  and your Pay From account will be debited on the Arrive By date you selected.  If the Bill Pay Service pays your Payee using the Check Payment Method, the payment method will display as “Check” on the History tab and your Pay From account will be debited on the Arrive By date you selected. Further, if the Bill Pay Service pays your Payee using the Draft Payment Method, the payment method will display as “Draft” on the History tab and your Pay From account will be debited when the Payee negotiates the Bill Pay Draft (meaning the Draft is presented for payment due to the Payee depositing or cashing the Bill Pay Draft).  The Draft Payment Method may result in your Pay From account being debited earlier than the Arrive By date.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Frequency and Dollar Limitations.</strong> For one-time and recurring Bill Payments, including payments to the Bank and to third parties as allowed by the Bill Pay Service, you may schedule as many one-time and recurring Bill Payments as you like. However, there are dollar limitations for each type of Bill Payment. Specifically, for Bill Payments made to the Bank in order to pay on a loan with us, either on a one-time or recurring basis, you may make a minimum Bill Payment of $.01 and a maximum of $10,000,000.00. Further, for Bill Payments to a third party, either on a one-time or recurring basis, you may make a minimum Bill Payment of $.01 and a maximum of $250,000.00. There are limitations on how far in the future you can schedule one-time and recurring Bill Payments. Please see below under the heading “Setting Up One-Time and Recurring Payments” for further information. 
<br>
<br>
<strong>Cut Off Hours; Business Days.</strong>   You may be able to make same day payments through the Bill Pay Service. Specifically, you can schedule a Bill Payment to make a loan payment to the Bank on the same Business Day that you log into the Bill Pay Service provided that you log in and successfully complete the Bill Payment instruction by 11:59 p.m. Pacific Time. However, whether you can schedule a Bill Payment to a third party on the same Business Day depends on the Payee and the Bill Pay Service. More specifically, the Bill Pay Service has an indicator as to the earliest “Arrive By” date that you can schedule for each Payee that is a third party.  Further, any recurring Bill Payment request you designate that falls on a Saturday, Sunday or a Bank holiday will be changed to have an Arrive By date that falls on the previous Business Day. Also, when you schedule Bill Payments to third parties, the Bill Pay Service will deem any Bill Payment instruction received after 6:59 p.m. Pacific Time on a Business Day as though it was received by the Bill Pay Service on the next Business Day.  
<br>
<br>
<strong>Setting Up One-Time and Recurring Payments. </strong> The Bill Pay Service allows you to set up one-time or recurring Bill Payments for each Payee. The frequency options for the recurring intervals to pay a particular Payee are set forth in the “Frequency” drop down menu offered by the Bill Pay Service. However, there are limitations on how far in the future you can schedule either a one-time or recurring Bill Payment. Specifically, any Bill Payment instruction for a future one-time Bill Payment may be scheduled 364 days in advance. Also, any Bill Payment instruction indicating a specific number of recurring Bill Payments to make a loan payment to the Bank or to make a payment to a third party may be scheduled for a maximum of 999 recurring payments. 
<br>
<br>
There is an exception to the 999 maximum number of payments limitation. Specifically, if you have a Payee that has presented you with an eBill (as defined below under the heading “eBill Delivery and Presentment”), then you may set up a recurring Bill Payment in the eBill Autopay feature, as defined below, to occur indefinitely. Please keep in mind that it is possible to have one or more Payees set up on both recurring or one-time Bill Payments and eBill Autopay which could cause a Payee to be paid twice.   
<br>
<br>
<strong>Payment Authorization and Remittance.</strong> By providing the Bill Pay Service with names and account information of Payees to whom you wish to direct Bill Payments, you authorize the Bill Pay Service and/or Payment Processor to follow the Bill Payment instructions that it receives through the Bill Pay Service. In order to process Bill Payments more efficiently and effectively, the Bill Pay Service may edit or alter Bill Payment data or data formats in accordance with Payee directives.
<br>
<br>
When the Bill Pay Service receives a Bill Payment instruction, you authorize the Bill Pay Service to debit your Pay From account and remit funds on your behalf so that the funds arrive as close as reasonably possible to the Arrive By date designated by you. You also authorize the Bill Pay Service to credit your Pay From account for Bill Payments returned to the Bill Pay Service by the United States Postal Service or Payee.  Further, you agree and acknowledge that any Bill Payments returned as an ACH credit will be handled as set forth below under the heading “ACH.”
<br>
<br>
The Bill Pay Service will attempt to make all your Bill Payments properly. However, the Bill Payment Service and/or Payment Processor shall incur no liability whatsoever for failure to complete a transaction (as described in Part B, Section 47, under the heading “Bank’s Liability”). Bill Payments shall be void if the Bill Pay Service is unable to complete any Bill Payments initiated by you because of the existence of any one or more of the following circumstances:
<br>
<br>
i. If, through no fault of the Bill Pay Service, your Pay From account does not contain sufficient funds to complete the transaction or the transaction would exceed the credit limit of your overdraft account;
<br>
<br>
ii. The Bill Pay Service is not working properly and you know or have been advised by the
Service about the malfunction before you initiated the Bill Payment request;
<br>
<br>
iii. You have not provided the Bill Pay Service with the correct Bill Payment information, or the correct name, address, phone number, or account information for the Payee; and/or,
<br>
<br>
iv. Circumstances beyond control of the Bill Pay Service (such as, but not limited to, fire, flood, or interference from an outside force) prevent the proper execution of the transaction and the Bill Pay Service has taken reasonable precautions to avoid those circumstances.
<br><br>

Provided none of the foregoing exceptions is applicable, if the Bill Pay Service causes an incorrect amount of funds to be removed from your Pay From account or causes funds from your Pay From account to be directed to a Payee which does not comply with your Bill Payment instructions, the Bill Pay Service shall be responsible for returning the improperly transferred funds to your Pay From account, and for directing to the proper Payee any previously misdirected transactions, and, if applicable, for any late payment related charges. However, there is a reimbursement limit of $50 for any late payment-related charges. 
<br>
<br>
<strong>Disconnected Online Session.</strong> If you are disconnected from the Bill Pay Service before you log out, we recommend that you log back onto the Bill Pay Service to verify that the Bill Payments or transfers you scheduled appear on your “Scheduled Payments” screen. If a scheduled Bill Payment or transfer is missing, call the Bank at 1-800-238-4486. Do not reissue any Bill Payment requests made during the interrupted session unless we advise you to do so. Otherwise, a duplicate Bill Payment could result. You authorize the Bank to pay any duplicate Bill Payments you issue. We will not be responsible for any Payee's refusal to return any duplicate Payments issued by you.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Rejected Payment Requests. </strong>  The Bank may reject a Bill Payment request if it appears to be fraudulent or erroneous. A Bill Payment request may also be refused if there is any uncertainty regarding the transacting party's authority to conduct the transaction, or if there is any dispute or uncertainty regarding the ownership or control of the Pay From account. We and the Payment Processor reserve the right to reject your Bill Payment request if profane, abusive, or threatening language is used in your instruction. Use of such language may result in cancellation of the Bill Pay Service and/or the Service.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Insufficient Funds. </strong> In using the Bill Pay Service, the Bank or the Payment Processor will make Bill Payments for you from your Pay From account when you instruct the Bank or Payment Processor to do so. After making such Bill Payments per your Bill Payment instructions, the Bill Pay Service will debit your Pay From account. If there are insufficient funds in your Pay From account, the Bank or Payment Processor may notify you directly and will attempt to debit your Pay From account a second time. If there are still insufficient funds, the Bank or the Payment Processor may contact you directly to seek reimbursement for Bill Payments made on your behalf as a result of executing your Bill Payment requests. In each such case, you agree that:
<br>
<br>
i.  You will reimburse the Bank or the Payment Processor immediately upon demand for the amount of the Bill Payment if we have delivered the Bill Payment to the Payee and there are insufficient funds in, or insufficient overdraft line of credit funds associated with, your Pay From account to allow us or the Payment Processor to complete the debit processing;
<br>
<br>
ii. For any amount not reimbursed to the Bank or the Payment Processor within fifteen (15) days of the initial notification, a late charge equal to one and a half percent (1.5%) monthly interest or the legal maximum, whichever rate is lower, for any unpaid amounts may be imposed by the Bank or the Payment Processor;
<br>
<br>
iii. You may be assessed a fee by the Payment Processor and by the Bank if the amount of the Bill Payment cannot be debited because you have insufficient funds in your Pay From account, or the transaction would exceed the credit or overdraft protection limit linked to your Pay From account, to cover the Bill Payment, or if the Bank cannot otherwise collect the funds from you; the fee amount will be as set forth in your fee schedule. This fee may also apply if we attempt to debit the Pay From account a second time. You hereby authorize us to deduct these amounts from your designated Pay From account, including by ACH debit;
<br>
<br>
iv. You will reimburse us and the Payment Processor (including Payment Processor's designated debt collection agency, if applicable) for any fees or costs the Bank and/or the Payment Processor incurs in attempting to collect any amounts from you; and
<br>
<br>
v. The Bank and the Payment Processor are authorized to report the facts concerning the debt to any credit reporting agency.

<br>
<br>
<strong>No Signature Required.</strong>  When a Bill Payment is requested using the Bill Pay Service, you agree that the Bank or the Payment Processor may charge your Pay From account to make the payment without your signature. Further, when using the Bill Pay Service to make transfers from Pay From accounts with insufficient available funds, you agree that the Bank and/or Payment Processor may continue to make Bill Payments on your behalf even though such action may cause an overdraft and/or a draw from a linked overdraft protection product without your signature for the draw. Finally, you agree and acknowledge that you will be responsible for all fees, charges and interest associated with overdrafts and/or draws on your linked overdraft protection product.  
<br>
<br>
<strong>Canceling or Modifying Payments.</strong>  After a Bill Payment request is transmitted through the Bill Pay Service, and while the Bill Payment is still in a “pending” state, you may use the Bill Pay Service to cancel or modify the pending Bill Payment on the Bank's "Scheduled Payments” tab in the Bill Pay section, or by calling us at 1-800-238-4486. Bill Payments in an “In Process or Processed” status cannot be cancelled or modified.  
<br>
<br>
The Bill Pay Service's ability to process a stop payment request for one or more scheduled Bill Payments will depend on the payment method (e.g. Electronic, Check or Draft) and whether the paper check, under the Check Payment Method, or Bill Pay Draft , under the Draft Payment Method, has cleared. The Bill Pay Service may also not have a reasonable opportunity to act on any stop payment request after a Bill Payment has been processed. If you desire to stop any Bill Payment that has already been processed, you must contact customer care for the Bill Pay Service at the number above, or in the manner set forth in Section 36 below. Although the Bill Pay Service will attempt to accommodate your stop payment request, the Bill Pay Service will have no liability for failing to do so. The Bill Pay Service may also require you to present your request in writing within fourteen (14) days. The charge for each stop payment request on a Bill Pay Draft will be the current charge for such service as set out in the applicable fee schedule. However, a stop payment request on a paper check under the Check Payment Method is $15.00. The placement of a stop payment request on a Bill Pay paper check or Bill Pay Draft could result in an inactivation of your Bill Pay profile.

<br>
<strong>eBill Delivery and Presentment. </strong>This feature is for the presentment of electronic bills (“eBills”) only and it is your sole responsibility to contact your Payees directly if you do not receive your statements. In addition, if you elect to activate one of the Bill Pay Service's eBill options, you also agree to the following:
<br>
<br>
i. Information provided to the Payee. The Bill Pay Service is unable to update or change your personal information such as, but not limited to, name, address, phone numbers and e-mail addresses, with the Payee. Any changes will need to be made by contacting the Payee directly. Additionally it is your responsibility to maintain all usernames and passwords for all Payee sites. You also agree not to use someone else's information to gain unauthorized access to another person's bill. The Bill Pay Service may, at the request of the Payee, provide to the Payee your e-mail address, mailing/service address, or other data specifically requested by the Payee at the time of activating the electronic bill for that Payee, for purposes of the Payee informing you about the Payee’s services and/or bill information.
<br>
<br>
ii. Activation. Upon activation of the eBill feature the Bill Pay Service may notify the Payee of your request to receive eBill information. The presentment of your first eBill may vary from Payee to Payee and may take up to sixty (60) days, depending on the billing cycle of each Payee. Additionally, the ability to receive a paper copy of your statement(s) is at the sole discretion of the Payee. While your eBill feature is being activated it is your responsibility to keep your accounts with each Payee current. Each Payee reserves the right to accept or deny your request to receive eBills from the Payee through the Bill Pay Service.
<br>
<br>
iii. Authorization to obtain bill data. Your activation of the eBill feature for a Payee shall be deemed by us to be your authorization for us to obtain bill data from the Payee on your behalf. For some Payees, you will be asked to provide us with your user name and password for that Payee. By providing us with such information, you authorize us to use the information to obtain your bill data.
<br>
<br>
iv. Notification. The Bill Pay Service will attempt to present all of your eBills promptly. In addition to notification within the Bill Pay Service, the Bill Pay Service may send an e-mail notification to the e-mail address listed for your account. It is your sole responsibility to ensure that this information is accurate. In the event you do not receive notification, it is your responsibility to periodically logon to the Bill Pay Service and check on the delivery of new eBills. The time for notification may vary from Payee to Payee. You are responsible for ensuring timely payment of all bills.
<br>
<br>
v. Cancellation of eBill notification. The Payee reserves the right to cancel the presentment of eBills at any time. You may cancel eBill presentment at any time. The timeframe for cancellation of your electronic bill presentment may vary from Payee to Payee. It may take up to sixty (60) days, depending on the billing cycle of each Payee. The Service will notify your electronic Payee(s) as to the change in status of your account and it is your sole responsibility to make arrangements for an alternative form of bill delivery. The Bill Pay Service will not be responsible for presenting any eBills that are already in process at the time of cancellation.
<br>
<br>
vi. Non-Delivery of eBill(s). You agree to hold the Service harmless should the Payee fail to deliver your statement(s). You are responsible for ensuring timely payment of all bills. Copies of previously delivered bills must be requested from the Payee directly.
<br>
<br>
vii. Accuracy and dispute of an eBill. The Bill Pay Service is not responsible for the accuracy of your eBill(s). The Bill Pay Service is only responsible for presenting the information we receive from the Payee. Any discrepancies or disputes regarding the accuracy of your electronic bill summary or detail must be addressed with the Payee directly.
<br>
<br>
viii. eBill Autopay.  The Bill Pay Service has a feature that is separate and independent from the rest of the Bill Pay Service. Specifically, when presented with an eBill through the Bill Pay Service, you are given the option to set up payment (“eBill Autopay”). You can use the eBill Autopay separate and instead of the normal Bill Payment functionality of the Bill Pay Service. Or, you can use the eBill Autopay separate and concurrently with the normal Bill Payment functionality of the Bill Pay Service.  If you give instructions for both a Bill Payment and an eBill Autopay, then your instructions under both features will be followed unless you specifically instruct the Bill Pay Service otherwise. 
<br>
<br>
With the normal Bill Payment recurring payment functionality, you can give instructions regarding the specific dollar amount, frequency, Arrive By date and Pay From account for a series of automatic Bill Payments to be made. But with the eBill Autopay functionality, you can give instructions for the amount, Arrive By date and Pay From account along with the ability to set additional parameters.  The additional parameters allow you to set how the particular Payee will <strong><u>always</u></strong> be paid each time the particular Payee presents you with an eBill through the Bill Payment Service.  Specifically, you can give an eBill Autopay instruction to always pay a particular Payee: (1) for the amount due; (2) only if the eBill amount due is less than or equal to a specific dollar amount; or (3) a specific dollar amount.  
<br>
<br>
The eBill Autopay feature also gives some additional flexibility with scheduling your Bill Payment. Specifically, you can schedule your Bill Payment through the eBill Autopay in one of the following ways: (1) to be delivered on the Due Date set forth in the eBill; (2) to be delivered on the earliest available date after the eBill is received by you through the Bill Pay service; or (3) to arrive one to five days before the Due Date set forth in the eBill.

</p>
















<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Sans-serif; font-size: 11px;">19.	<strong>Mobile Check Deposit.</strong> You can deposit a check through the use of your mobile device (“Mobile Check Deposit”).  Specifically, Mobile Check Deposit enables you to deposit checks to your Union Bank deposit account using an iPhone®, iPad®, or Android™ mobile wireless electronic device.  An image of the front and back of the physical check, taken using your wireless device, is transmitted to us through the Union Bank Mobile Banking application and processed for deposit into your account.  Following your deposit, we send email confirmation of your deposit to the email address we have for you on record in the Service.  The physical check is not later deposited or processed.  For Mobile Check Deposit, you must be a Union Bank customer for at least 1 Business Day, and your account must be in good standing.
<strong>Eligible Accounts. </strong> Mobile Check Deposit is available only for deposits into a Bank checking, money market, or savings account.  Mobile Check Deposit cannot be used to deposit checks into a certificate of deposit, or a Portfolio Connection® account. Also, Mobile Check Deposit cannot be used to make loan payments.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Eligibility Requirements.</strong>  At our discretion, we may establish customer eligibility requirements to deposit checks using Mobile Check Deposit.  We may further establish limits on amount and frequency of deposits.  We may change such eligibility requirements and deposit limits without prior notice to you.  If a deposit exceeds current limits, it will not be processed.
<br>
<br>

At our discretion and without prior notice to you, we may further restrict the types and attributes of checks that will be accepted and processed using Mobile Check Deposit.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Your Responsibilities.</strong>  You agree that, once you have deposited a check using Mobile Check Deposit, you will not cash the check, nor negotiate, transfer or deliver the check to any other person or entity, nor deposit the check again through Mobile Check Deposit, at an ATM, in person at a branch (unless we have directed you to do so), at another financial institution, or through any other means.  Do not destroy the original check until the deposit appears on your periodic account statement.  Until it appears on the statement, you agree to keep the physical check securely stored to prevent theft or misuse.  After the deposit has appeared on your statement, you agree to safely destroy the original check. 
<br>
<br>
Successful completion of a Mobile Check Deposit is dependent upon a good-quality original check and a clear photograph of the front and back of the check.  You agree that you are responsible for accurately photographing the front and back of the check according to our instructions.  You acknowledge that not all checks that meet our deposit criteria can be successfully deposited through Mobile Check Deposit due to the sensitivity and complexity of image recognition technology or other reasons, such as use of unconventional check stock or failure or interruption of any data transmission channels.  You acknowledge and agree that we are not responsible for any loss or liability that you may incur due to inability to deposit, or delay in depositing, a check using Mobile Check Deposit.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Funds Availability.</strong>  Generally, funds, representing a deposit using Mobile Check Deposit, will be available for withdrawal the Business Day after deposit if the Mobile Check Deposit is made prior to 9:00 p.m. Pacific Time. However, in some cases, we may delay funds availability up to the 2nd Business Day after deposit. We will notify you electronically by email if we delay availability of your deposit. Funds availability rules set forth in Federal Reserve Regulation CC do not apply to checks deposited using Mobile Check Deposit.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Right to Reject.</strong>  We reserve the right to reject a check deposit at the time the deposit is attempted using a mobile or wireless device.  We further reserve the right, upon subsequent review of the deposited check, to cancel the deposit and reverse prior credit to your deposit account for the amount of the deposited check due to non-negotiability of the check or any other reason that we may determine.  We will notify you electronically through the mobile device of our immediate rejection of a deposit.  If we subsequently cancel a deposit and reverse credit to your account, we will notify you by email.
<br>
<br>
We may, upon subsequent review of a deposited check, adjust the amount of the deposit to conform to the legal amount of the check as determined by us.  Our determination will be considered final.  We will notify you by email of such adjustment.

<br>
<br>
<strong>Warranties.</strong>  A check deposit made using Mobile Check Deposit is subject to the same warranties and representations as though the physical check were deposited, and is subject to the terms and conditions of your Account Agreements.
</p>
















<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Sans-serif; font-size: 11px;">20.	<strong>Send Money (Available only to Personal Account customers).</strong>  

<br>
<br>
The Service allows you to use your mobile device to initiate a funds transfer from your Bank checking or money market account or your Portfolio Connection® account (specifically from the cash balance portion of your Portfolio Connection® account) (‘Funding Account”) to a consumer or business located within the United States. Payment instructions to send money through the Service are referred to as a “Send Money” or “P2P” payment.
<br>
<br>

To initiate a Send Money payment request, you must provide the recipient’s email address or mobile telephone number. After the Service processes the payment, the recipient will be notified by email or mobile text message by PayPal, Inc. (“PayPal”), Union Bank’s third-party funds transmitter for Send Money payments, of the availability of the transferred funds.  
<br>
<br>

<strong>Frequency and Dollar Limitations.</strong> Each Send Money payment request through the Service has a minimum requirement of $1.00 and maximum limit of $500.00.  Also, your aggregate total of Send Money payment requests within the last 30 days cannot exceed $1,000. See Section 27 of this OLB Agreement for additional information about limited transactions. The Bank reserves the right to limit the frequency and dollar amount of transfers initiated through the Service for Send Money payments requests. Such frequency and dollar limits may change from time to time without prior notice to you unless prohibited by law. If a Send Money request would exceed any limits in effect at the time you initiate the Send Money request, then the Send Money payment request will not be processed.
<br>
<br>

<strong>Fees.</strong> Currently there are no fees imposed by the Bank to process your Send Money payment request.  However, the recipient may incur a fee by PayPal pursuant to a separate agreement with PayPal.  Specifically, although there are no fees associated with Send Money payments classified as “Friends and Family,” PayPal may impose a fee for Send Money payments classified as “Good and Services.”  You agree and acknowledge that, if the fee imposed by PayPal reduces the amount of your Send Money payment, the Bank will not be liable in any manner whatsoever for your damages. 
<br>
<br>

<strong>Mobile Device Requirements. </strong>Send Money is conducted through the Bank’s Mobile Banking application and requires you to have a mobile device with certain capabilities. For current device requirements, see Section 8 of this OLB Agreement.
<br>
<br>

<strong>Recipient Requirements.</strong> In order to send funds as a Send Money payment through the Service, the recipient must have registered the receiving email address or mobile wireless number with PayPal. In the event the recipient does not register the email or mobile wireless number with PayPal, your Send Money Payment will be returned to the Bank 31 days after you scheduled the Send Money payment.  The Bank will credit the Funding Account for the full amount of the returned transferred funds within 3 Business Days thereafter.
<br>
<br>

<strong>Payment Authorization. </strong> You agree that, each time you initiate a Send Money payment request through the Service, you are authorizing and instructing us and/or PayPal to send emails or text messages to the recipient on your behalf. You further agree that each person or business to whom we send emails or text messages on your behalf has given you permission for the Bank and/or PayPal to do so.
<br>
<br>

<strong>Funding Account.</strong> The Funding Account will be debited immediately for the amount of the Send Money request.  You must have sufficient available funds in the Funding Account at the time you initiate a Send Money payment request through the Service.  If there are insufficient available funds in the Funding Account at the time you initiate the Send Money payment request, then your Send Money payment request will not be processed. The Service will not access overdraft protection or overdraft coverage services, such as Cash Reserve Account, Savings Overdraft Protection Plan, or overdraft coverage, to make up for any shortage in available funds in order to fund a Send Money payment request.
<br>
<br>

<strong>Modifying or Cancelling Send Money Instructions.</strong> Once the Service sends your Send Money payment, it cannot be modified. Your Send Money payment request may be canceled only if the recipient has not registered the receiving email address or mobile wireless number with PayPal to accept the Send Money payment request. A Send Money payment request may be canceled only through Mobile Banking.  If you cancel a Send Money payment request, the Service will re-credit the Funding Account within 3 Business Days after cancellation.
<br>
<br>

<strong>Privacy.</strong> You agree that emails or text messages sent to the recipient by us or PayPal may identify you by name, email address or mobile wireless number. Other non-public personal financial information will be shared only in accordance with Union Bank’s published Privacy Policy and Online Privacy Practices. See Section 46 of this Agreement.
<br>
<br>

<strong>Data and Messaging Charges.</strong>  By delivering a Send Money payment request through the Service, you acknowledge that you and the recipient may be charged message and data rates or other fees by the applicable wireless carrier. Such carrier-imposed fees are the sole responsibility of you and/or the recipient and not the Bank or PayPal. 
<br>
<br>

<strong>Rejecting Send Money Payment Request.</strong> The Bank and/or PayPal may decline to send one or more of your Send Money payment requests delivered through the Service if the Funding Account has insufficient available funds, if the Send Money payment would cause you to exceed the frequency or dollar limits for such transfers in effect at the time you initiate the transfer, or otherwise at our discretion. In the event the Service declines to process your Send Money payment request, you will receive immediate notification through your mobile device that the Send Money payment will not be sent. If necessary and at our discretion, the Bank may withhold such notification for security reasons.
<br>
<br>

<strong>Prohibited Send Money Payment Requests.</strong> You agree not to use the Service to initiate and deliver to the Bank and/or PayPal any Send Money payment request for illegal or unlawful purposes, including Internet gambling. You must not use the Service to make Send Money payment requests to pay taxes or other amounts owed to government entities or to pay court- ordered amounts, such as alimony or child support.
<br>
<br>

<strong>Send Money Payment Message.</strong> The Service may permit you to add a description or message to the recipient as part of a Send Money payment request. You agree not to include inappropriate or abusive language as part of the message content. You further agree that the Bank and/or PayPal may monitor such message content and may, in the Bank’s or PayPal’s sole discretion, delete or edit the message if the Bank or PayPal believes that any of the content is inappropriate or abusive. Use of inappropriate or abusive language in message content may result in cancellation of your ability to Send Money payment requests through the Service or of the Service.
</p>
  
  
  
  
<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Sans-serif; font-size: 11px;">21.	<strong>Request a Domestic Wire.</strong> You may initiate a wire transfer through the Service from an Activated Account to a destination within the United States.  Transaction limits apply.  For security reasons, we may require additional verification of your identity prior to authorizing the wire transfer.  All wire transfers are subject to the terms and conditions of the Union Bank Master Funds Transfer Agreement and Security Procedures (“MFTA”), which you agree and acknowledge is deemed agreed to each time the MFTA is presented for each one of your wire requests. Also, you agree and acknowledge that your initiation of a wire transfer through the Service constitutes your agreement to the MFTA Agreement.  A wire transfer fee will be imposed for a completed wire transfer. Refer to the applicable Account Agreement for more information.</p>





<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Sans-serif; font-size: 11px;">22.	<strong>Place a Stop Payment on a Paper Check.</strong>  You can use the Service to place a stop payment order for a traditional paper check you have written on any Activated Account on which you can write checks.  To do so, you must provide us with timely, complete and accurate information regarding the account number the item is drawn upon, the check number, and the exact amount of the check (dollars and cents).  If any information is incomplete or incorrect, we will not be responsible for failing to stop payment on the check. Also, depending on the date you request a stop payment, we may not be able to verify whether the check has been paid, in which case we may ask you to contact us.  Stop payment requests become effective only when we confirm their receipt and have verified that the check has not been paid.  Thus, be sure to wait for an online confirmation that a stop payment was placed before you log out of the Service.
<br>
<br>
To place a stop payment covering a range of checks that are missing or stolen, you must call us at 1-800-238-4486 for personal assistance, or contact your banking office. Other terms and conditions governing stop payments are contained in your applicable Account Agreement.
</p>


  
  
  
  
  
  
  


<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Sans-serif; font-size: 11px;">23.	<strong>Alerts.</strong>  Your enrollment in the Service allows you to elect to receive transaction alerts and notifications (“Alerts”).  Alerts are electronic notices from us that contain transactional information about the Union Bank account(s) you have designated (“Designated Account”).  For example, Alerts may include information about the receipt of wire transfers or other credits to an account, about withdrawals that exceed a certain dollar amount, or if overdraft protection is used on your account.  Alerts must be set up online through the Service.  You cannot set up Alerts though your mobile device.


<strong>Agreement and Acknowledgement.</strong>  By subscribing to the Alerts feature of the Service, you acknowledge and agree that: (a) Alerts are provided solely as a convenience; (b) Alerts are not a substitute for the periodic statements for your Designated Accounts or any other notices we may send you about such Designated Accounts, without regard to the manner in which you have chosen to receive such periodic statements or other notices; (c) such periodic statements and other notices remain the official records of your Designated Accounts; and (d) your ongoing obligation promptly to review periodic statements, Customer Notices, and all other correspondence from us regarding your Designated Accounts and other services you obtain from us remains in full force and effect.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Your Responsibilities; Indemnification.</strong>  You agree to provide us a valid mobile phone number or email address so that we may send you Alerts.  Additionally, you agree to indemnify, defend and hold us harmless from and against any and all claims, losses, liability, cost and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising in any manner from your providing us a phone number, email address, or other electronic delivery location that is not your own or that you provide in violation of applicable federal, state or local law, regulation or ordinance.  Your obligations under this paragraph shall survive termination of this OLB Agreement.  
<br>
<br>
<strong>Methods of Delivery.</strong>  We may provide Alerts through one or more channels: (a) a mobile device, by text message, (b) a mobile device, by push notification; or (c) an email account, by an e-mail message.  It is your responsibility to determine that each of the service providers for the communication media described in (a) through (c), above supports the email, push notification, and/or text message Alerts you selected above. You agree that the Alerts are subject to the terms and conditions of your agreements with your service provider(s) and that you are solely responsible for any fees imposed for an Alert by your service providers.  By electing Alerts delivery to a Web-enabled mobile or cellular device, you agree to receive Alerts through that device.  Message and data rates may be imposed by your service provider.  The frequency of Alerts delivered to your mobile or cellular device depends upon the frequency of events triggering requested types of Alerts.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Alert Information is Not Encrypted.</strong>  You acknowledge and agree that: (a) Alerts may not be encrypted and may include personal or confidential information about you and your transactions, such as your name and account activity or status;  (b) your Alerts may be delayed, misdirected, not delivered, or corrupted due to circumstances or conditions affecting your service providers or other parties; and (c) we will not be liable for losses or damages arising from: (i) any non- delivery, delayed delivery, misdirected delivery, or corruption of an Alert, (ii) inaccurate, untimely or incomplete content in an Alert; (iii) your reliance on or use of the information provided in an Alert for any purpose; or (iv) any other circumstances beyond our control.
</p>









<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Sans-serif; font-size: 11px;">24.	<strong>Contact in Event of Unauthorized Transfer.</strong> If you believe your Code has been lost or stolen, call: 1-800-238-4486 or write:  Claims Operations, Union Bank, PO Box 2327, Brea, CA 92822-2327.<br>
  <br>You should also call the number or write to the address listed above if you believe a transfer has been made using the information from your check without your permission.
</p>











<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Sans-serif; font-size: 11px;">25.	<strong>Duty to Review.</strong>  You agree to review promptly all statements, Customer Notices, and transaction information made available to you, and to report all unauthorized transactions and errors to us immediately.</p>










<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Sans-serif; font-size: 11px;">26.	<strong>Fees.</strong>  In addition to the fees elsewhere described in this OLB Agreement, you agree to pay the fees set forth in the applicable Fee Schedule and any additional fees that the Bank may establish from time to time, as they may communicated to you outside of the Fee Schedule.  Please copy and paste the following applicable url into your browser to locate an electronic version of your Fee Schedule: unionbank.com/accountterms or unionbank.com/business/accountterms.  You are also responsible for telephone, mobile, data, message, internet and other similar types of fees incurred by you as a result of accessing and/or using online and mobile banking services. </p>

<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Sans-serif; font-size: 11px;">27.	<strong>Excess Activity Charge.</strong> Federal regulation limits certain types of withdrawals or transfers from your savings or money market account (including online/telephone transfers and Deposit Overdraft Protection transfers) to a maximum of six (6) each monthly statement period (money market accounts) or calendar month (savings accounts or money market accounts when the statement period date was requested on a specific day).  Union Bank will charge a $15 Excess Activity Charge for each excess transfer paid against the account. <br>
<br>
If you exceed these limits, the Bank is required to close your account or convert your account to one not subject to transfer limitations. If your account is closed or converted due to excessive activity, you will not be able to open another Union Bank savings and/or money market account for 12 months.  Please see the applicable Account Agreement for more information.
We further reserve the right to limit the frequency and dollar amount of transactions from your
Activated Accounts for security reasons.
</p>

<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Sans-serif; font-size: 11px;">28.	<strong>Confidentiality.</strong> We will disclose information to third parties about your account or the transfers you make:<br>

(i)	Where it is necessary for completing transfers, or<br>

(ii) 	In order to verify the existence and condition of your account for a third party, such as a credit bureau or merchant, or<br>

(iii) 	In order to comply with government agency or court orders, or<br>

(iv) 	If you give us your written permission.

</p>

<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Sans-serif; font-size: 11px;">29. <strong>Periodic statements.</strong> You will get a monthly account statement (unless there are no transfers in a particular month. In any case you will get the statement at least quarterly).</p>






<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Sans-serif; font-size: 11px;">30. <strong>ACH.</strong><br>
  
  <strong>Authorization.</strong> You agree and acknowledge that when you use the Service to initiate a transfer to make a payment to someone (including yourself when the account receiving the funds is held elsewhere) other than the Bank, such as a Bill Pay to a third party or an external transfer, that you authorize the Bank, Payment Processor and/or PayPal, to initiate an ACH transaction to your account.  Also, you agree that for recurring transfers, this authorization will remain in effect until revoked by you through the Service or by calling us at 1-800-238-4486.<br>
<br>
You agree and acknowledge that the origination of all ACH transactions to your account must comply with U.S. law.  Also, you agree that the rules governing ACH credits and
debits will not apply to any type of transfer request for which the ACH was not actually
utilized.  Further, you agree and acknowledge that when you set up any one-time or recurring transfer through the Service to make a payment to someone you will print a copy of the applicable page or screen within the Service for your records. 

<br>
<br>
<strong>Notice.</strong> You agree and acknowledge that the Bank is not required to give you next day notice after the Bank’s receipt of any ACH credit for a rejected or returned transfer request, instead notification is sufficient by posting the re-credited amount to the applicable deposit account used for the debit and listing it on your periodic statement.
<br>
<br>

<strong>Provisional Payment.</strong>  There is an ACH rule that makes payment of an ACH credit entry
provisional until the financial institution, which holds the deposit account that is credited for the ACH credit entry, is in receipt of final settlement for such ACH entry. You specifically agree and acknowledge that you have received notice of this ACH rule. Further, if there is no final settlement, then the financial institution will be entitled to a
refund from the person who authorized the ACH credit entry  and you will not be deemed to have paid the amount of the ACH credit entry. For example, if you initiate an external funds transfer request where funds are coming from your external deposit account held at another financial institution in order to be credited to your internal deposit account held at the Bank and the Bank credits you the amount of the external funds transfer request and you do not have the money in your external deposit account held with your financial institution to settle the external transfer request, then we may debit your deposit account that you hold with the Bank in the amount of the ACH credit entry and you will not be deemed to have paid the external transfer request.
<br>
<br>

<strong>Reliance on Your Instructions.</strong>  We are not responsible for detecting any errors in any
transfer requested by you through the Service. You are responsible for the content of any transfer instruction and the Bank may rely upon the information you provide to the Bank when processing the transfer instruction.  The Bank and any other financial institution may rely solely on the account numbers and bank identifying numbers that you provide to the Bank regardless of whether or not you also provide the name of the account holder or the name of the financial institution. We and other financial institutions processing your transfers have no responsibility to identify or investigate any discrepancy between names and account numbers. Also, your obligation to pay the amount of any transfer request will not be excused in circumstances where your transfer request describes the name and account number inconsistently or the name and identifying number of the financial institution inconsistently.
</p>





<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Sans-serif; font-size: 11px;">31.	<strong>Hours of Operation and Cutoff Times.</strong>  The Service is available to you 24 hours a day; 365/366 days a year, except at times of "Service Unavailability" (see Section 32). Your Activated Account information is updated at 6:00 a.m. (Pacific Time) Tuesday through Friday and 8:00 a.m. (Pacific Time) on Saturday, except on Bank holidays.

Once we have processed the transfer request, the transfer cannot be canceled or stopped.  Transfers can be scheduled for the current Business Day or up to one year in the future and on a one-time or a recurring basis.

<br>
<br>
Telephoning us is the fastest way to reach us.  We may not immediately receive email that you send to us.  Therefore, you should not rely on email if you need to communicate with us immediately, for example, if you need to report a lost or stolen card or password, or report an unauthorized transaction from one of your accounts.  We cannot take action on your email request until we actually receive your message and have a reasonable opportunity to act.
<br>
<br>
Email or social network websites may not be used to request account information or to conduct transactions with us.  Also, because email and social network websites may not be secure, never include confidential, financial, or account information when using those communication channels. If in doubt, contact us at 1-800-238-4486 or call your banking office.
</p>

<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Sans-serif; font-size: 11px;">40.	<strong>Severability.</strong>  If any provision of this OLB Agreement is determined to be void or invalid, the rest of the OLB Agreement will remain in full force and effect.</p>

<br>
<br>
Part B sets forth terms and conditions that only apply to Personal Accounts. Specifically, you agree and acknowledge that Part A and Part B of this OLB Agreement apply to Personal Account customers. Further, if you are a Business Account customer, you agree and acknowledge that this Part B does not apply to your Business Accounts and/or the Service.
<br>
<br>
Finally, you agree and acknowledge that the Regulation E disclosures set forth below in this Part B does not apply to domestic wires (wires sent within the U.S., its territories and possessions). 
</p>

<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Sans-serif; font-size: 11px;">43.	<strong>Authorized User Access.</strong>  As an owner of an Activated Account, you may act alone in using the Services pursuant to this OLB Agreement to perform account transactions. Such access is granted completely at the Bank’s discretion. Contact us at 1-800-238-4486 for additional information.</p>

<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Sans-serif; font-size: 11px;">44.	<strong>Account Transfers to Accounts Not Owned By You.</strong>  Transfers from an Activated Account to an account at another financial institution that you do not own or that we have not verified (“Non-Owned External” account) or an account at Union Bank not owned by you (“Unverified Account”) may be made through the Service.  You may make these two types of transfers from an Activated Account, which is checking, savings or money market accounts held at the Bank and your Portfolio Connection® account (specifically from the cash balance portion of your Portfolio Connection® account), to an Unverified Account or to an Non-Owned External account at another U.S. financial institution that supports and permits such transfers.  There are no frequency limitations for these two types of transfers.  However, there are dollar limitations.  Specifically, the Service may limit the amount of each Unverified Account or Non-Owned External account transfer to $5,000.  It may be possible that you may be eligible for higher limits.   Such transfers settle within two Business Days.</p>

<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Sans-serif; font-size: 11px;">45.	<strong>Text Banking.</strong>  Our text banking service (“Text Banking”) allows customers of the Service to use a mobile device to perform certain banking functions by entering an abbreviated code into the messaging application on your mobile device.  Such banking functions include, but may not be limited to, checking account balance and recent transactions, locating branch offices or ATMs, and transferring funds between your Union Bank deposit accounts (subject to the transfer limitations set forth in this OLB Agreement).  Text Banking capabilities may be modified by us at any time without prior notice to you.
<br>
<br>
Text Banking requires you to have a mobile device with certain capabilities. For current device requirements, see Section 8.
<br>
<br>
Upon entering an abbreviated code into your mobile device, you will receive a response from us by text message to the same device.  By activating and using Text Banking, you agree to receive text messages on your mobile device.  Message and data rates may be imposed by your wireless service provider.  The frequency of messages delivered to your mobile device depends upon the frequency of Text Banking requests.
<br>
<br>
Text Banking responses are provided solely as a convenience. They are not a substitute for the periodic statements or any other notices we may send you about your account.  Such periodic statements and other notices remain the official records of your account, and your ongoing obligation promptly to review account statements, Customer Notices, and all other correspondence from us regarding your account and other services you obtain from us remains in full force and effect.
</p>

<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Sans-serif; font-size: 11px;">46.	<strong>Online Privacy.</strong>  For information about how we gather, use, and secure your nonpublic personal information, see Union Bank’s current Privacy Policy and statement of Online Privacy Practices at www.unionbank.com/privacypolicy.</p>

<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Sans-serif; font-size: 11px;">47.	<strong>Regulation E Consumer Disclosures.</strong>  The following disclosures apply only to consumers and to electronic funds transfers, as defined in Regulation E, to or from a consumer deposit account held with the Bank:
<br>
<br>
<strong>Consumer Liability.</strong> Tell us AT ONCE if you believe your Code has been lost or stolen, or if you believe that an electronic fund transfer has been made without your permission using information from your check. Telephoning is the best way of keeping your possible losses down. You could lose all the money in your account (plus your maximum overdraft line of credit). If you tell us within 2 business days after you learn of the loss or theft of your Code, you can lose no more than $50 if someone used your Code without your permission.
<br>
<br>
If you do NOT tell us within 2 business days after you learn of the loss or theft of your Code and we can prove we could have stopped someone from using your Code without your permission if you had told us, you could lose as much as $500.
<br>
<br>
Also, if your statement shows transfers that you did not make, including those made by Code or other means, tell us at once. If you do not tell us within 60 days after the statement was mailed to you, you may not get back any money you lost after the 60 days if we can prove that we could have stopped someone from taking the money if you had told us in time. If a good reason (such as a long trip or a hospital stay) kept you from telling us, we will extend the time periods.
<br>
<br>
<strong>In Case of Errors or Questions About Your Electronic Transfers.</strong> Telephone us at 1-800-238-4486 or write us at Union Bank, P.O. Box 2327, Brea, CA 92822-2327 as soon as you can, if you think your statement or receipt is wrong or if you need more information about a transfer listed on the statement or receipt. We must hear from you no later than 60 days after we sent the FIRST statement on which the problem or error appeared.
<br>
<br>
(1) Tell us your name and account number (if any).
<br>

(2) Describe the error or the transfer you are unsure about, and explain as clearly as you can why you believe it is an error or why you need more information.
<br>

(3) Tell us the dollar amount of the suspected error.
<br>
<br>
If you tell us orally, we may require that you send us your complaint or question in writing within 10 business days.
<br>
<br>
We will determine whether an error occurred within 10 business days after we hear from you and will correct any error promptly.  If we need more time, however, we may take up to 45 days to investigate your complaint or question. If we decide to do this, we will provisionally credit your account within 10 business days for the amount you think is in error, so that you will have the use of the money during the time it takes us to complete our investigation.  If we ask you to put your complaint or question in writing and we do not receive it within 10 business days, we may not provisionally credit your account.
<br>
<br>
For errors involving new accounts, point-of-sale, or foreign-initiated transactions, we may take up to 90 days to investigate your complaint or question.  For new accounts, we may take up to 20 business days to credit your account for the amount you think is in error.
<br>
<br>
We will tell you the results within three business days after completing our investigation. If we decide that there was no error, we will send you a written explanation. You may ask for copies of the documents that we used in our investigation.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Preauthorized credits.</strong> If you have arranged to have direct deposits made to your account at least once every 60 days from the same person or company, you can call us at 1-800-238-4486 to find out whether or not the deposit has been made.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Preauthorized payments; Right to stop payment and procedure for doing so.</strong> 
<br>
<br>
If you have told us in advance to make regular payments out of your account, you can stop any of these payments. Here's how:
<br>
<br>

If you call, we may also require you to put your request in writing and get it to us within 14 days after you call.  Except for the $15 fee for stop payment on a paper check under the Check Payment Method, as defined above for the Bill Pay Service, we not will charge you for each stop-payment order you give on a preauthorized payment subject to this OLB Agreement. 
<br>
<br>
<strong>Notice of varying amounts.</strong> If these regular payments may vary in amount, we will tell you, 10 days before each payment (however, when it comes to eBill Autopay, as defined above for the Bill Pay Service, the person you are going to pay will tell you), when it will be made and how much it will be. (You may choose instead to get this notice only when the payment would differ by more than a certain amount from the previous payment, or when the amount would fall outside certain limits that you set.)
<br>
<br>
<strong>Liability for failure to stop payment of preauthorized transfer.</strong> If you order us to stop one of these payments 3 business days or more before the transfer is scheduled, and we do not do so, we will be liable for your losses or damages proximately caused by us.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Bank's Liability.</strong> If we do not complete a transfer to or from your account on time or in the correct amount according to our agreement with you, we will be liable for your losses or damages proximately caused by us. However, there are some exceptions. We will not be liable, for instance:
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
(c) If the Service was not working properly and you knew about the breakdown when you started the transfer or transaction or activity;

<br>
<br>
(f) The payment or transfer would exceed the credit limit under any credit arrangement established to cover negative balances;
